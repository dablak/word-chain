Word Chain
==========

Possible solution to the exercise proposed in the Aberdeen Python dojo of 26th November 2014.


Goal
----

Connect two words with a chain of words. All words must be valid and there must be only one character different between each neightbour.

For example: cat - cot - cog - dog


About this solution
-------------------

This is not the most efficient way to find a word chain and it's neither a way to wind the shortest path. But it's one of the most simple solutions.

You can improve it for example using known algorithms to find shorter paths, like A*., or some other heuristics.
